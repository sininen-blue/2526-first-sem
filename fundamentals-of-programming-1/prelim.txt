1. Primitive Questions
What are primitive data types in programming? Give two examples.
Which primitive type would you use to store:
- a whole number?
- a single character?
- a true/false value?
True or False: A primitive type can store multiple values at the same time.
Name the primitive data type in Python for storing decimal numbers.
In your own words, explain the difference between an integer and a floating-point number.

2. Aspect of Language Questions
What is syntax in a programming language?
What is semantics in a programming language?
Why is indentation important in Python?
# Define “reserved keyword” and give an example 
# Explain the difference between compile-time error and runtime error.

3. Define Object
What is an object in programming?
# How does an object differ from a primitive value?
# Give an example of a real-world object and list at least two attributes it could have.
In Python, how would you check the type of an object?
True or False: In Python, even strings are objects.

4. Operation Questions
What is the difference between = and == in Python?
Write an expression that adds 10 to a variable x.
What is the output of 5 % 2? Explain.
What operator is used for exponentiation in Python?
If a = 5 and b = 2, what is the result of a / b in Python 3?

5. Variable Questions
What is a variable in programming?
True or False: A variable’s name can start with a number.
Why do we assign values to variables instead of using numbers directly everywhere?
What is the output of the following?
```python
x = 7
x = x + 3
print(x)
```
How do you name a variable so that it is easy to understand for future readers?

6. What Are Strings
What is a string in programming?
Give two ways to create a string in Python.
How would you get the length of a string in Python?
True or False: Strings can store numbers without converting them.
What will this print?
```python
print("Hello" "World")
```

7. Input and Output Questions
What Python function is used to display text to the user?
What Python function is used to receive input from the user?
Why is input from the input() function always a string?
How do you convert a user’s input into an integer?
Write code to ask the user for their name and greet them.

8. Branching Questions
What is the purpose of an if statement?
Write an example of an if statement that checks if a number is positive.
What is the difference between if and if-else?
What keyword is used to add more conditions after an if?
Explain what the following code does:
```python
if temperature > 30:
    print("Hot")
else:
    print("Cold")
```

9. Loop Questions
What is a loop in programming?
Name two types of loops in Python.
Why are loops useful?
How do you prevent an infinite loop?
Explain what this loop does:
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

10. While Loop Questions
What keyword starts a while loop in Python?
When does a while loop stop running?
What’s the risk if the condition in a while loop is never false?
Write a while loop that counts from 1 to 5.
True or False: A while loop can run zero times.

11. For Loop Questions
What is a for loop used for?
Write a for loop that prints each letter in "cat".
What function is often used with a for loop to generate a sequence of numbers?
How many times will this loop run?
```python
for i in range(3):
	print("Hello")
```
How many times will this loop run?

12. Break Questions
What is the purpose of the break statement?
What happens to the rest of the loop when break is executed?
Write a loop that stops when the user enters "stop".
True or False: break can only be used in while loops.
Explain the output:
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```
