Concepts that I like and want to teach
- sending
- objects as a way of making debugging easier
- polymorhipsm through unchanging interfaces
- dangers of inheritance


for mini midterm project

I want to give students a python file with a set class called `ItemHandler`, 

it has the public interfaces
- paginate
- find by id
- partial search
- create
- create multiple
- update
- delete

as well as a few others

and the job of a student is to implement a new class inheriting `ItemHandler`, and then an `Item` class based on what object I gave them

based on an object that I give them that has the interfaces item handler can use
