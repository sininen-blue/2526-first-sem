# Math
We're going to be doing a lot of math

---

# Basics
Scalars, points, and vectors

These are the three fundamental types

Note that we will be distinguishing between the `abstract` definition and any `implementation` of these types

---

## Scalars

Real numbers

---

## Points

A location in space with neither size nor shape

---

## Vectors

Directions with a magnitude and no fixed position

---

## Vector Operations

Scalar multiplication

---

## Vector Operations

Vector addition

---

## Vector Operations
Inverse

---

## Vector Operations
Point Vector addition

# Coordinate Free Geometry

# Vector, Affine, and Euclidean Spaces

Mathematical sets can be viewed as spaces, each with different ways of manipulating the elements of the set

---

## Scalar field

---

## Vector field (linear)

Vectors and Scalars

---

## Euclidean Space

Extension of vector space with distance 

---

## Affine Space

Extension of vector space with points

---

# Abstract Data Types
Type defined by behavior

want to tangent here

---

## Geometric ADT

---

## Notation

---

## LineLines

---

## Affine Sums

---

## Convexity

---

## Dot and Cross Products

---

## Planes
