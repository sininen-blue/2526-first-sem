## Modeling a Colored Cube

We now have *most* of the conceptual knowledge required to build a three-dimensional graphical application. 

<img class="mx-auto rounded w-1/4" src="./images/day_11/fig1.png" alt="Colored Cube">

The goal is to create a rotating colored cube

1. Where we'll first model the cube
2. then introduce affine transformations to rotate it
3. And finally use a model view matrix to view it from a camera perspective.

## Define the Cube's Vertices

While we can represent a cube like two-dimensional shapes, simply as a set of vertices in an array

It would make things easier to handle the relationships between vertices, edges, and faces if we used a data structure.

In WebGL, this is typically done through using **vertex arrays**

---

## Define the Cube's Vertices

A cube is one of the simplest three-dimensional object we might need to model and display.

A CSG system would consider it as a **single primitive**, and a hardware process would define it as **8 vertices**

Because we use a *surface-based* model, we can approach the cube as a set of 6 planes, sometimes called *facets*, that comprises its faces.

A carefully designed data structure should support both a **high-level** application specification of a cube and a **low-level** model needed for implementation.

## Define the Cube's Vertices

We first start by assuming that the vertices of a cube are available in an **array of vertices**. Either in a vector 3 format, or in vector 4 to factor in the *homogenous coordinates**

Though with `MV.js` there is no difference as it automatically adds the homogeneous coordinate on the `vec3` data type.

```javascript
var vertices = [
    vec3(-0.5, -0.5, 0.5),
    vec3(-0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
    vec3( 0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
    vec3( 0.5, -0.5, 0.5),
    vec3(-0.5, -0.5, -0.5),
    vec3(-0.5, 0.5, -0.5),
    vec3( 0.5, 0.5, -0.5),
    vec3( 0.5, -0.5, -0.5)
];
```

```javascript
var vertices = [
    vec4(-0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.0),
    vec4(-0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0),
    vec4( 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0),
    vec4( 0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.0),
    vec4(-0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 1.0),
    vec4(-0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 1.0),
    vec4( 0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 1.0),
    vec4( 0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 1.0)
];
```

## Homogenous coordinates

When representing a vector in 3 dimensions, there will always be confusing on whether or not it's a point or a vector

Consider what happens when we move from a coordinate system, just basis vectors. To a frame with an origin point.

We would define a point as
$$
P = P_0 + xv_1 +yv_2 + zv_3
$$

Where $x, y, z$ are the components of the point. The problem is that's *really close* the same representation of a vector. And if you read it as purely the representation, it's **exactly** the same

So given $x, y, z$, without added context, it can be read as both a point at $x, y, z$ or a vector from the origin to the location $x, y, z$

## Homogenous coordinates

To avoid this, we simply use a 4 dimensional representation for both points and vectors 

and so $P$ can be represented purely from its components as

$$
P = 
\begin{matrix}
    \alpha_1 \\ 
    \alpha_2 \\ 
    \alpha_3 \\ 
    1
\end{matrix}
$$

Whereas a vector would be represented as 

$$
v = 
\begin{matrix}
    \beta_1 \\ 
    \beta_2 \\ 
    \beta_3 \\ 
    0
\end{matrix}
$$

::right::

This **preserves** already existing transformations, though with **16** scalars instead of 9. But it changes how a translation function (which is usually represented as a 4Ã—4 matrix in homogeneous coordinates) interacts with the object.

A point, with a **4th scalar of 1**, will be affected by a translation. While a vector, with a **4th scalar of 0**, will not

Are we sending points or vectors?

```javascript
var vertices = [
    vec4(-0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.0),
    vec4(-0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0),
    vec4( 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0),
    vec4( 0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.0),
    vec4(-0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 1.0),
    vec4(-0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 1.0),
    vec4( 0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 1.0),
    vec4( 0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 1.0)
];
```

## Inward or outward pointing faces

The order in which we define our vertices matters.

We used the order **0, 3, 2, 1** for the first face

And **1, 0, 3, 2** would be the same because the final vertex position in a polygon specification is linked back to the first

But the order 0, 1, 2, 3 is different

It describes the same boundary but the face will now point inward rather than outward.

A right hand rule is used to determine the orientation of the face based on the order of the vertices.

---

## Data structures for object representation

We could use

```javascript
let faces = new Array(6);

for (let i = 0; i < faces.length; ++i) {
    faces[i] = new Array(4);
}
```

or

```javascript
var faces = new Array(24)
```

---

## Data structure for object representation

where vertices[i] would contain the x, y, z coordinates of the $i$th vertex in the list.

Both of these methods *work* but they fail to capture the essence of the cubes **topology**, only the *geometry*

If we think of the cube as a *polyhedron*, a 3d figure with flat polygonal faces, we have an object that has 6 faces

- Each of those faces are quadrilaterals that meet at vertices
- each vertex is shared by 3 faces
- pairs of vertices define an edge
- each edge is shared by two faces 

These statements describe the topology of a cube

> A topologist is a person who cannot tell the difference between a coffee mug and a donut

---

## Topology vs Geometry

all are true, **regardless of the location** of the vertices, meaning that they're true regardless of the geometry of the object.

By separating the topology from the geometry, we can create a more flexible and reusable data structure.

We can create this kind of system by defining a *cube* that's *composed* of six faces, where each face consists of four ordered vertices, and each vertex can be specified indirectly through its index

<img class="mx-auto rounded w-1/2" src="./images/day_11/fig2.png" alt="Cube Data Structure">

One major advantage of this approach is that each geometric location appears only once, instead of being repeated for each face.

If in a program, the location of a vertex is changed, every instance of that vertex will automatically reflect the change.

---

## Colored cube

We can then define a cube with color attributes by using a function `quad` that takes four vertex indices in outward pointing order and a color as parameters.

```javascript
function colorCube()
{
    quad(1, 0, 3, 2);
    quad(2, 3, 7, 6);
    quad(3, 0, 4, 7);
    quad(6, 5, 1, 2);
    quad(4, 5, 6, 7);
    quad(5, 4, 0, 1);
}
```

---

## Colored cube

and by setting up a `vertexColor` array to hold some colors

```javascript
var vertexColors = [
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], // black
    [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], // red
    [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0], // yellow
    [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0], // green
    [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0], // blue
    [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0], // magenta
    [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], // white
    [0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] // cyan
];
```

---
## Colored cube

Then finally define the `quad` function to push the vertices and colors into the appropriate arrays

```javascript
function quad(a, b, c, d)
{
    let indices = [a, b, c, a, c, d];
    for (var i = 0; i < indices.length; ++i) {
        positions.push(vertices[indices[i]]);
        colors.push(vertexColors[indices[i]]);
    }
}
```
