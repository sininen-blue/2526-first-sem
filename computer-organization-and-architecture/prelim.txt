Answer: B

In the 1960s, operating systems were introduced primarily to:
 Replace machine language with high-level languages
 Reduce hardware costs
 Simplify and speed up program execution
 Replace interpreters with compilers
Answer: C

Why did some architectures eventually remove microprogramming?
 It was too expensive to store the microcode
 It slowed down execution compared to direct hardware execution
 It made compilers unnecessary
 It increased instruction set size which added lots of complexity
Answer: B

Levels and Abstractions – Explain the concept of a multilevel machine. Why are multiple abstraction layers useful for both hardware designers and programmers?

Translation vs. Interpretation – Compare translation and interpretation in terms of performance, control flow, and practicality. Give an example scenario for each.

Microprogramming Benefits – Explain why microprogramming was considered a major innovation in the 50s.

Drawbacks of Early Programming Practices – Discuss the challenges of “open shop” programming before operating systems existed.

Virtual Machines – Describe how a virtual machine is related to the concept of a "level" in computer architecture. Include an example from the notes.

Elimination of Microprogramming – Why did some architectures later remove microprogramming? What were the trade-offs?

Hardware-Software Equivalence – Explain the statement “hardware and software are logically equivalent.” Give an example of something that can be implemented either way.
